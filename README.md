## Introduction

This project aims to simulate a basic **event loop** and **task queue** in **Brainf*****, an esoteric programming language. The simulation includes core concepts like memory management, task scheduling, and an event loop. This project is ideal for anyone interested in how event-driven programming can be represented in a minimalistic language.

## Features

- Event Loop Simulation: A simple but effective event loop in Brainf***.
- Task Management: Add and execute tasks in sequence.
- Memory Visualization: Monitor memory state and task queue.
- Modular Code: Code is broken down into separate files for clarity and ease of modification.

## Installation

To get started, you’ll need a Brainf*** interpreter or a Python-based tool included in this project. Follow the steps below to set it up.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x (for the Brainf*** interpreter tool)
- Git (for cloning the repository)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/brainfuck-event-loop.git
    cd brainfuck-event-loop
    ```

2. **Install dependencies (if any):**

    This project doesn't require any external dependencies but includes Python utilities for visualization and debugging.

3. **Run the Brainf*** code using the provided interpreter:**

    You can run any `.bf` file with the `bf-interpreter.py` script:
    ```bash
    python tools/bf-interpreter.py src/main.bf
    ```

    Alternatively, you can run any other Brainf*** code stored in the `src/` or `examples/` directories.

## Usage

After installation, you can start exploring and running the project with the following options:

### Running the Event Loop

To run the event loop example:

```bash
python tools/bf-interpreter.py src/main.bf
```

This will execute the main event loop code, processing tasks in sequence.

### Running Examples

Explore the examples in the `examples/` folder. You can run these in the same way by specifying the respective file, e.g.,

```bash
python tools/bf-interpreter.py examples/task-example.bf
```

This will execute a simple task that shows how tasks can be added and executed.

### Testing

The project includes a set of tests to verify that memory management and task handling work as expected. You can run the tests in the `tests/` folder.

```

## Examples

### Task Example

This example shows how to execute a basic task using the event loop:

```bash
python tools/bf-interpreter.py examples/task-example.bf
```

### Asynchronous Simulation

To simulate asynchronous tasks, use the `async-simulation.bf` file. This demonstrates how tasks can be added and processed:

```bash
python tools/bf-interpreter.py examples/async-simulation.bf
```

## Tests

The tests are located in the `tests/` directory. You can run them using the same Python interpreter.

### Example Test

To test the memory management, run:

```bash
python tools/bf-interpreter.py tests/test-memory.bf
```
